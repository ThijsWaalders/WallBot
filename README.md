# Extra Information

## Liquidity in Crypto Space

a

### What is Liquidity

b

### How to Use Liquidity

c

## Three Different Kinds of Ways Transactions Can Happen

### Peer to Peer

Trades occur between wallets (peer to peer: from wallet to wallet)

Like on centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges.

### Automated Market Maker (AMM)

Trades occur between the user and a **Smart Contract (SC)** (peer to contract, so no middleman)

`amount of token 1 * amount of token 2 = constant`

Raise token 1 and lower the amount of token 2, token 1 gets cheaper and token 2 gets more expensive, because there is less of it.

### SWAPS

Swaps can have no effect, to a little effect, to a massive effect to liquidity pools
